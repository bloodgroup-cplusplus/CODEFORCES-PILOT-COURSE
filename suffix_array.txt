s= ababba
Let's write all suffix array of this string in lexicographical order
'' a, ababba abba ba babba bba
storing the strings itself the order is o(n2). So instead of storing the entire suffix we will store the index of
the suffix (first letter)
If we enumerate the letters of the string 
Each suffix can be uniquely identified by the index of the first letter of this suffix.
empty suffix starts from end of the string

say s= ababba
	   0123456
	   
empty suffix has index 6 
a has index 5
ababba has index 0
abba has index 2
ba has index 4
babba has index 1
bba has index 3

so this array of integers corresponds to the suffix of the string.
[6,5,0,2,4,1,3]
this array will be the suffix array of the string.


Step1 
How to build this array of integers.
Before starting the algorithm we insert some special charracter which is lexicographically less than any character in the string
so $ will be appended to each of the prefix

now we have
$
a$
ababba$
abba$
ba$
babba$
bba$
adding dollar doesn't effect the ordering

Step 2 
Make some kind of cyclic strings by adding the dollars to the string so that each of the suffixes become of equal length


e.g.,
we have ba$
and say our original string is ababba$
so our string is going to be ba$ababb now it's completed and all the lengths of the strings is seven
we repeat these process to all other suffixes

so our final suffixes lexicographically arranged and having same length.
6--> $ababba
5--> a$ababb
0--> ababba$
2--> abba$ab
4--> ba$abab
1--> babba$a
3--> bba$aba

If we copare the strings  just find the dollar sign and don't go further after that.
Instead of sorting the suffixes we have the cyclic shifts of initial strings we need to sort the cyclic shitfts
of some string



STEP 3
Making string the power of two by just adding one more character here.

bba$abab----> length 8 power of 2
babba$ab
ba$ababb
abba$aba
ababba$a
a$ababba
$ababba$

Now what we need to sort the strings which are the cyclic shifts of the original string
with some additional characters so that total length is power of 2
Now we will build the table
